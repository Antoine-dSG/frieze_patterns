In this project, we formalise in Lean 4 the claim that the sequence of maximums of values of (Coxeter) frieze patterns is the Fibonacci sequence. 
A Latex file with the exact statements will be made available i) on the blueprint, and ii) in the note "On upper bounds in frieze patterns" posted at https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16717 .

Most of the project will consist in formalising the pre-requisits, including:
1) Definition of a (Coxeter) frieze pattern
2) Translation-invariance of frieze patterns
3) Classification of frieze patterns
4) Main theorem about the sequence of largest values taken by frieze patterns
