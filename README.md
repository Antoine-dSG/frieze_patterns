In this project, we formalise in Lean 4 the claim that the sequence of maximums of values of (Coxeter) frieze patterns is the Fibonacci sequence.

Most of the project will consist in formalising the pre-requisits, including:
1) Definition of a (Coxeter) frieze pattern
2) Translation-invariance of frieze patterns
3) Classification of frieze patterns
4) Main theorem about the sequence of largest values taken by frieze patterns
