\chapter{Classification of arithmetic frieze patterns}
\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:poly-to-fp}
\uses{def:arith-fp}
    Fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$. There is a set-theoretic bijection from the set of triangulations of the regular $n+3$-gon in the plane
    to the set Frieze$(n)$. In particular we have
    \[
        |\text{Frieze}(n)| = C_{n+1},
    \]
    where $C_n = \frac{1}{n+1}\binom{2n}{n}$ is the $n^{\rm th}$ Catalan number.
\end{theorem}

The remainder of this section is dedicated to the proof of Theorem \ref{thm:poly-to-fp}.
